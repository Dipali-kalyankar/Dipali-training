                  â€œLibrary -- from the Latin liber, meaning "book." In Greek and 
                  the Romance languages, the corresponding term is bibliotheca. 
                  A collection or group of collections of books and/or other print or 
                  nonprint materials organized and maintained for use (reading, consultation, 
                  study, research, etc.).

                  Libraries are community hubs. They connect people to information and connect people to people. 
                  They are safe havens for kids, providing after-school homework help, games, and book clubs. 
                  They offer computer classes, allowing older adults to stay engaged in a digital world.
